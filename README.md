This repository provides an implementation of Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation for traveling salesman problem (TSP). 
This formulation was introduced by [Miller, Tucker, and Zemlin (1960)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/321043.321046) and has been widely considered as one of two classical formulation of TSP. 

## Usage and Dependencies
